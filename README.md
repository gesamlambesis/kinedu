This is a web app to parents can register the progress of their babys

The architecture is based on react atomic design where all the components are independient. Using react styled components to can have a clean and easy to understand. 

The challenge was choose a right way to use redux, finally i decided save all milestones with their skills as objects to make it more scalable. Now if we wants to add more skills to register the progress maybe we can replace the switch component for a better component where we can set more options to switch.
